            <p> If you are reading this, thanks for taking the time to read and view my online CV. I made this personal website over a
                long weekend to get in touch with a front-end project a bit, as I was always doing back-end stuff. Obviously it is a
                simple static website with some JavaScript and CSS, but it's better than nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site has been primarily created following an <strong> MDB </strong> tutorial and is hosted on <strong> Amazon Web
                Services S3 </strong> from my personal <strong> Amazon </strong> account.

                Also, I wanted to play a bit with the <strong>Youtube API</strong> (although at the end I did not include it because of the
                overlapping problems with the content on mobile and tablet devices), <strong>Google Maps API</strong>, the <strong> Open
                Graph protocol </strong> by <strong> Facebook </strong> and the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong>.

                If you want to know the reason for the name of the website, you are looking for an employee or whatever, do not be shy and
                contact me on LinkedIn!
